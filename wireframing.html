		<p>I have really enjoyed going on Mashable for a number of Years. I beleive it was some time in the last two years that they updated the deisgn of their website. Like all updates it took some getting used to. However, after the initial adaptation phase, I grew to enjoy the improvements. </p>

		<p>BuzzFeed has been growing in popularity in the past couple years. The countless hours I spend scrolling, and opening tabs on tabs of articles, only prove that the site is very addicting. The format of the articels make it easy to read. The list format makes it consise. Although the articles are short, the time spent on the website can be very long due to its funny and quirky way of presenting news and other fun topics. </p>

		<p>Thrillist is my newest "favorite" website. After being told I would like it on numerous occasions, I finally gave in last month. And turns out, I do like it. Thrillist is a culture website. Highlighting Food,Drink, Travel in many cities as well as references to pop-culture, sports and fashion. There design is nice. I like the drop down menus as well as the full sreen picture to highlight the main article. </p>
