		<p>The purpose of Mashable is to report news with a focus on technology. Recently Mashabe underwent a websitre redisng. The new website focuses on three important areas, "New","Next Big Thing", and "Whats Hot." The way the new layout is desinged it makes the reader focus on these core elements. If you would like to change categories it is easily accessable on the top bar. </p>

		<p>BuzzFeeds design is very cluttered. The purpose of BuzzFeed is to deliver news and other fun articles in a fast easy to read fashion. Their category options are unique, with options such as "lol","omg", and "fail."Looking at the homepage it has a lot going on. However one thing BuzzFeed does well is integrate ads into their stream of articles. Having articles be sponsored is a great way to make money for BuzzFeed. </p>

		<p>Thrillist has the most simple website design out of the three on this page. The purpose of Thrillist is to keep people updating on cool and intersting happenings in the city of their choice. The design is great but focuses heavily on pictures. When you hover over a picture text comes up showing you how many clicks it has gotten, amount of shares, and the title of the articlce. </p>
